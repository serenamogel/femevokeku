Moreover, according to her&nbsp;appearance on BuzzFeed News' morning show "<a href=#>AM to DM</a>" in 2019, she is never going back to the social sphere. "I honestly think now with social media and stuff, it's great to have freedom of expression, but I do feel like people think opinions have so much weight," Ridley observed, continuing, "I don't really think bad vibes should have the sun shone on them. Like, I don't want to read your thing."</p><p>Much like her relationship with social media, Ridley just doesn't think she's cut out for public attention itself. As the accomplished actor told Glamour in 2017, "I'm just not equipped for it. I'm super sensitive — not too sensitive — but I really feel things." Ridley also shared with <a href=#>The Irish Times</a>&nbsp;her thoughts on the Hollywood rumor mill. "Everybody needs to be more accountable for what they post and what they share," Ridley stated. "Recently, I met someone that knew of someone I vaguely knew that knew something about me they shouldn't have known. I was, like, 'Yeah, please don't talk about stuff like that.'"&nbsp;</p><p>"People think they know things about you, and that they know you — it's a constant imbalance," Ridley languished to the British outlet, adding that she was "of course, grateful and lucky" for the opportunities fame afforded her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xna4Jye9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2Zrqq%2F2GapopycmsZuvdSiq2ahnqjBorPRmqRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
