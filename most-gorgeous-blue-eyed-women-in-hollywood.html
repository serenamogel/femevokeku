The eyes can’t hide a person’s feelings or emotions, which are otherwise entirely concealed by other facial features.</p><p>Different colors, shapes, and sizes of eyes make them look unique, and a perfect combination of all three makes eyes look beautiful. The Iris of an eye is responsible for different colors. Lack of concentration of melanin in the stroma of the Iris is responsible for blue eyes.</p><p>Blue eye color is gradually receding in human beings and is mostly found in parts of Europe, Northern areas, and Ireland. People with blue eyes are becoming extinct in America, so anyone with blue eyes can easily steal the show anywhere.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2 dir=auto data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><span class=ez-toc-section id=top-gorgeous-blue-women-who-stand-out-with-their-eyes-in-hollywood></span>Top Gorgeous Blue-Women <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Stand Out with their Eyes in Hollywood</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-angelina-jolie></span>1. <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Height: 5′ 7″</strong><br><strong>Hair color: Dark Brown</strong><br><strong>Eye color: Blue</strong><br><strong>Birthday: June 4, 1975</strong><br><strong>Age: 47 years</strong></p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2553 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthycelebrity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Angelina-Jolie-natural-eye-color-blue-eyes.png.webp alt="Angelina Jolie natural eye color - blue eyes" width=801 height=440 title="Angelina Jolie natural eye color blue eyes" sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://wealthycelebrity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Angelina-Jolie-natural-eye-color-blue-eyes.png id=mv-trellis-img-14 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-2553 class=wp-caption-text>Angelina Jolie natural eye color – blue eyes</p><p>The multi-talented Angelina Jolie is a Hollywood superstar who is best known for winning multiple accolades, awards, and humanitarian work.
