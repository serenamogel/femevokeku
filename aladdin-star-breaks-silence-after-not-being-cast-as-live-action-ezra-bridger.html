Yesterday, it was reported that King Richard alum Eman Esfandi had been chosen by Lucasfilm to bring Ezra to life, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which was then confirmed by numerous outlets shortly after</a>.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Naturally, those hedging their bets on Massoud getting the nod will be left disappointed, but if anything, the 30 year-old seems pretty relieved. Having generally avoided being drawn into the scuttlebutt since his name first started getting bandied around, the Jack Ryan alum admitted that he’s glad a line can now be drawn under the constant rumors.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Glad the rumors will stop now. Never really had a fair shot at it unfortunately (1 self-tape months ago) but just wasn’t meant for me I guess. Can’t deny the dude looks exactly like Ezra. Hope it’s done justice!</p>— Mena Massoud (@MenaMassoud) <a href=#>September 9, 2022</a></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mena-massoud-ezra-bridger.jpg><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=false>The initial story that broke the news of Esfandi’s casting mentioned that Massoud was in talks with Disney for the part, so we’d be very curious to find out the whole story given that the latter implies in his tweet that he “never really had a fair shot”. On the plus side, we now have our Ezra Bridger, and while his debut hasn’t been confirmed, it wouldn’t exactly be a shock were it to be confirmed later today <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that he’ll be joining Natasha Liu Bordizzo’s Sabine Wren and Rosario Dawson’s title hero in Ahsoka</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiuMCdm6KmXajBor6Mm6memZuoerS1y56lnJ1dlrO1sdFmpaisXZeyqrrGZpqaq6RirrR5y6KtnmWRmMGqu81mnLOqkWKvs7XDoJyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
