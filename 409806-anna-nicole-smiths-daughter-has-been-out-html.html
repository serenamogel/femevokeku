However, the joyous occasion quickly turned into sorrow as Daniel was found unresponsive in his mother's hospital room at about 9:00 a.m. on September 10, 2006. Despite immediate medical attention, he was pronounced dead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/be50b95beedf2aafdb1f8bdafcffffb8755b287d932018192e7ec33b90d8a4b4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Anna Nicole Smith (1967-2007), at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 11, 1993 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>An autopsy revealed that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/anna-nicoles-son-dies-daughter-is-born/>Daniel died</a> from a "cocktail" of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-annanicole/anna-nicoles-son-died-of-drug-overdose-jury-says-idUSN3V21495120080331>prescription drugs,</a> including methadone, which was a devastating discovery for the family.
