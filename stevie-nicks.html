The band’s members <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/fleetwood-mac-rumours-album data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="faced many personal challenges" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">faced many personal challenges</a> but, nevertheless, triumphed critically and commercially. Its sophomore album, Rumours, has sold more than 21 million copies and won Album of the Year at the 1978 Grammy Awards. Nicks has also enjoyed a successful solo career—despite years of struggling with addiction—with the hit album Bella Donna and popular songs “Edge of Seventeen” and “Stop Dragging My Heart Around,” with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/tom-petty data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tom Petty" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tom Petty</a>.

Her well-known nickname, Stevie, reportedly came from her childhood pronunciation of “Stephanie” as “tee-dee.” Nicks’ mother and father, Barbara and Jess, first met at Arizona State University. They became college sweethearts, and the couple married in 1947. Barbara was a homemaker, and Jess had a career as a corporate executive.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The tight-knit Nicks clan included the future singer’s paternal grandfather, Aaron Nicks, a would-be <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/country-singers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="country star" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">country star</a>. Aaron handcrafted a guitar for young Stevie and taught her well-known selections from the country music cannon. By the time she was 5 years old, Nicks was gigging with him at local gin mills. Around this time, her brother, Christopher, was born.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Nicks’ father rose through the corporate ranks, the Nicks family skipped around Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and California. By 1963, the family landed in the suburbs of Los Angeles, and Nicks enrolled at Arcadia High School. While there, she met her best friend, Robin, and joined Changing Times, a band patterned after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/the-mamas-and-the-papas-origins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Mamas and The Papas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Mamas and The Papas</a>. Her tenure with the group was short-lived; the Nicks family soon moved to Palo Alto, California, where Nicks attended Menlo Atherton High School. Here, Stevie met classmate Lindsey Buckingham, a guitarist and fellow songwriter. The two shared a close bond and forged a strong musical partnership.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Relationship with Lindsey Buckingham" data-anchor-id=relationship-with-lindsey-buckingham class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Relationship with Lindsey Buckingham</h2><img alt="steve nicks and lindsey buckingham smile at the camera embracing each other in this black and white photo" title="Steve Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham in 1976" width=3340 height=2253 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/members-of-fleetwood-mac-from-left-john-mcvie-stevie-nicks-news-photo-1692208855.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, seen here in 1976, have been longtime musical collaborators and were in a romantic relationship for several years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After high school, Nicks briefly enrolled in San Jose State College, but by 1968, she had dropped out. The Nicks family relocated once again—this time, to Chicago—but Nicks opted to stay in California. Along with Buckingham, she joined the local band, Fritz, which established a small following. The group opened for bigger acts such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/janis-joplin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Janis Joplin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Janis Joplin</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jimi-hendrix data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimi Hendrix" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jimi Hendrix</a> before they disbanded in 1971.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By this time, Nicks and Buckingham were deeply romantically involved. The couple continued to collaborate and soon landed a contract with Polydor Records. In 1972, they released Buckingham-Nicks, an album that went largely unnoticed. In an effort to make ends meet, Nicks worked alternately as a maid, a dental assistant, and a waiter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Concurrently, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Christine McVie of the rock group Fleetwood Mac struggled with band tensions and lineup changes. In 1974, the group started seeking out a new recording facility and arranged a visit to Sound City Studio in the San Fernando Valley—the same studio where Stevie and Buckingham recorded their album. As producer Keith Olsen guided Fleetwood Mac through the facility, he showcased the studio’s sound capabilities by playing the Buckingham-Nicks track “Frozen Love.” The band was taken with Buckingham’s guitar sensibilities.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 title="Fleetwood Mac" data-anchor-id=fleetwood-mac class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Fleetwood Mac</h2><img alt="mick fleetwood, stevie nicks, lindsey buckingham, christine mcvie, and john mcvie smile and pose for a photo together" title="Fleetwood Mac, circa 1975" width=2952 height=2265 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo-of-fleetwood-mac-l-r-mick-fleetwood-stevie-nicks-news-photo-1692208708.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, and John McVie joined musical forces in 1975 to reinvigorate the band Fleetwood Mac.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A few weeks later, Fleetwood Mac’s then-guitarist Bob Welch quit the band. In need of a guitarist, Fleetwood remembered Buckingham’s track and arranged a meeting with the musician. The group asked Buckingham to join the band, but he refused to collaborate unless Nicks was part of the deal. Fleetwood agreed, and in 1975, Nicks and Buckingham signed on to Fleetwood Mac.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The newly forged band quickly recorded an eponymous collection that sold 500,000 copies by December 1975 and went on to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart the next fall. Nicks’ tracks—especially the mystical “Rhiannon” and the romantic ballad “Landslide”—were smash hits and transformed the singer into a sensation. Subsequent touring efforts showed audiences Nicks’ hallmark flowing outfits and whirling onstage dances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1976, the band started recording their sophomore effort, but their personal lives were in total disarray. The rigors of touring had strained Nicks’ voice, and she sought medical help. The band was also in the middle of an emotional upheaval, and all of its romantic relationships disintegrated: The McVies decided to divorce, Fleetwood and his wife separated, and Nicks and Buckingham were in the midst of a tumultuous split.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Dive Deeper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The band continued to record together, however, and their next album, Rumours (1977), became a record-setting hit. It spent 31 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, went platinum in both the United States and the U.K., and earned the group a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Nicks’ song “Dreams,” inspired by the group’s dissolving relationships, was the band’s first and only No. 1 single. During this time, Nicks had a brief affair with band member Mick Fleetwood and began an up-and-down relationship with Eagles drummer Don Henley.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Today, Rumours remains the band’s most successful album, having sold more than 21 million copies. “Dreams” saw a resurgence in popularity following a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/@420doggface208/video/6876424179084709126 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="viral TikTok video" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">viral TikTok video</a> from September 2020.

In 1981, she released Bella Donna, which featured guest vocalists <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/tom-petty data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tom Petty" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tom Petty</a> and Tom Henley. The album almost immediately reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and featured the hit singles “Edge of Seventeen” and “Leather and Lace,” as well as a duet with Petty called “Stop Dragging My Heart Around.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nicks continued on at a prodigious rate, recording 1982’s Mirage with Fleetwood Mac and her second solo effort, The Wild Heart, in 1983. Around this time, Stevie’s best friend, Robin, died from leukemia. In an effort to provide a mother for Robin’s young son, Matthew, Nicks married Robin’s widower, Kim Anderson. The relationship lasted less than a year.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 title="Addiction Struggles" data-anchor-id=addiction-struggles class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Addiction Struggles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although it went platinum, Nicks’ 1985 solo album, Rock A Little, didn’t match the commercial success of her previous efforts. The singer also started developing serious problems with alcohol and drugs. She maintained a severe cocaine habit that eventually created a hole in her nasal cartilage. In 1986, she entered <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/betty-ford-addiction-alcoholism-center data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Betty Ford Clinic" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">the Betty Ford Clinic</a> for a 28-day rehab program, which helped end her chemical dependence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following year, she began working with a psychiatrist who recommended she take Klonopin. Although she was done with cocaine, Nicks became addicted to the tranquilizer and was under its influence throughout the better part of the late ’80s and early ’90s. During this time, she continued to tour and turn out independent records as well as albums with Fleetwood Mac, including the solo effort The Other Side of the Mirror (1989), Behind the Mask (1990) with Fleetwood Mac, and a solo compilation entitled Timespace (1991).</p><h2 data-node-id=35 title="Detox and Rock Hall of Fame" data-anchor-id=detox-and-rock-hall-of-fame class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Detox and Rock Hall of Fame</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After years of addiction, weight gain, and exhaustion, Nicks fully detoxed in 1993 and ended her ties to Klonopin. The next year, she released Street Angel, another solo album. As her health improved and she regained energy, Nicks returned to the studio to record new songs for multiple soundtracks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1997, Fleetwood Mac reunited and released The Dance. The related tour earned them $36 million. Nicks also put out a boxed set dubbed Enchanted and added two songs to the soundtrack for Practical Magic, the 1998 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sandra-bullock data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sandra Bullock" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sandra Bullock</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/nicole-kidman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicole Kidman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nicole Kidman</a> movie.
