But every time the UFC offers him a fight, he turns it down. In an interview with Kevin Hart for his new podcast <strong>Cold As Balls,</strong> Mayweather said he knows how much money he could make if he agreed to fight in MMA.</p><p>Subsequently, the 46-year-old stated, “I can go get a deal right now from the UFC. Probably a three-fight, four-fight, billion-dollar deal if that’s what I wanted.” Mayweather said he doesn’t have to worry about money, and he’s not in a hurry to get into the Octagon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, since his August 2017 boxing match with Conor McGregor, Mayweather has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maintained his link to the UFC</a>.

However, Mayweather was trying to compare McGregor’s skills to himself and stated that he is a knockoff version. Mayweather also stated that he takes his hat off in respect to him because he is an underdog.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Furthermore, Conor McGregor’s performance against Floyd Mayweather may not have been what fans wanted, but it was impressive. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McGregor fought ten rounds</a> against one of the most skilled boxers in the last 50 years in his boxing debut.
