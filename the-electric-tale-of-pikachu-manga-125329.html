I got them over ten years ago.<p>Over the years, I've tried to get into Pokemon Special and Adventures, but they just haven't grabbed me. <i>This</i> series, on the other hand, has always captured my attention -- it was just so...<i>different</i>, from both the anime and the games. I loved how it explained elements of the Pokemon world in a way that even my 7 year-old brain could understand them. It was more serious, and I really got a kick out of thinking about the depicted technological advances. Remember that cool Pokedex that had a hologram screen? I always wanted one of those - in fact, I used to want to invent that kind of technology. I think we can all guess as to how far I got, but the spirit's still there.</p><p>And after finding those issues again, I realized just how much I still enjoy them, and the series overall. It has a lot of good memories for me, and I'm sure for a lot of other people, too. Not a single one of my friends has ever heard of the series, and they've all been enthralled by the single issue that I showed them, which is specifically <i>Play Misty for Me</i>. I personally think that this series deserves wider recognition, but maybe that's just me.</p><p>As a very small side note, I got so many ideas from finding my four or five remaining single-chapter issues that I've decided I'm going to write a fanfiction using the depicted world as the setting and basis, along with the first season of the anime. Since my personal knowledge of this particular incarnation of the setting is, at best, very limited, I would really love some guidance from someone who knows this series better than I do. Anyone up for it?</p><p>Putting my musings and project aside, let's get some discussion going!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMRmnKWdk6m%2Fqq%2BMrZilnV2ks268yKSYnKClYrqiusaaZWpqZWh%2Fens%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
