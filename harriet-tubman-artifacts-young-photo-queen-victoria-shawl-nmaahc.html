In addition to aiding runaways, she served as a scout, spy, cook and nurse for the Union Army during the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Civil War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Civil War</a>. Sarah H. Bradford, an antebellum author, recorded the earliest biographies of Tubman’s life: Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman (1869) and Harriet, the Moses of Her People (1886), although Tubman insisted on a revision of the first to provide readers with a more authentic chronology. Tubman donated the proceeds from these books to raise funds for poor and elderly African Americans. Today, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nmaahc.si.edu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Museum of African American History and Culture " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">National Museum of African American History and Culture </a>includes in its collection several artifacts relating to Tubman’s life including her shawl, on display in the exhibit <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nmaahc.si.edu/slavery-and-freedom data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Slavery and Freedom,”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“Slavery and Freedom,”</a> and a very rare photograph of a young Tubman.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Rebirth of Tubman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born into slavery as Araminta “Minty” Ross, around 1820 or 1822, Tubman grew up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her parents, Harriet Green and Benjamin Ross, had a large family consisting of about nine children. We do not know where Tubman fell in the birth order, but we know that she witnessed the sale of at least two of her sisters and it had a lasting impact on her. The harsh realities of slavery haunted her childhood and, as a result, she ran away for the first time at age seven. She reluctantly returned to her enslaver after hiding in a pigpen for four days. During her adolescence, Tubman suffered from a head injury that nearly killed her and left visible and psychological scars for the rest of her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1844, when she was in her early twenties, she married a free Black man named John Tubman. Five years later, she made a decision to free herself from slavery leaving her husband behind. Like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/sojourner-truth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sojourner Truth" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sojourner Truth</a>, Tubman’s decision was based on faith. Through her self-liberation, she became reborn as “Harriet,” perhaps in honor of her mother. She remained a fugitive in the North and Canada until abolition in 1865. Tubman worked with anti-slavery activists and helped others escape slavery. She went back to the South on three occasions to rescue her family and was disappointed in 1851 when her husband refused to join her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From this point forward she became a conductor in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/underground-railroad data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Underground Railroad" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Underground Railroad</a> and made regular trips to the southern states ushering enslaved African Americans to freedom. She was very active in the 1860s, especially during the Civil War. In 1863, she led <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog/combahee-ferry-raid data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an armed raid " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">an armed raid </a>that resulted in freeing more than 700 enslaved people living near the Combahee River in South Carolina. Tubman died in 1913, in her 90s, surrounded by loved ones. She was commemorated at a well-attended stately memorial, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/booker-t-washington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Booker T.

In addition to the photograph of Tubman, taken by photographer Benjamin F. Powelson of Auburn, New York, the album contains pictures of other abolitionists, including Lydia Marie Child. Tubman appears to be in her 40s in the photograph. To date, this is the youngest image of Tubman we are aware of and it allows us to see her as she was in the late 1860s. In this studio photo, Tubman is seated on a wooden chair, facing right, gazing slightly off-camera. One of her hands is positioned on the chair, the other is on her lap resting on a full skirt of gingham check. She has on a dark-colored bodice buttoned at the center with heavy ruching on the sleeves. Her hair is parted down the middle and pulled back to the nape of her neck meeting a white lace collar.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A Gift From Queen Victoria</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The second object in the NMAAHC collection relating to Tubman is the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2009.50.39?destination=explore/collection/search%3Fedan_q%3Dharriet%2520tubman%26edan_local%3D1%26op%3DSearch" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="white silk lace and linen shawl" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">white silk lace and linen shawl</a> given to her by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-victoria data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Victoria" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Queen Victoria</a> of England around 1897, the year of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Even though Tubman did not attend this special event, it is believed that Queen Victoria sent the shawl as a gift along with the commemorative medal dignitaries received for attending. According to two scholars, the medal was pinned to Tubman’s black dress and she was buried with it.</p><img alt="Harriet Tubman Lace Shawl Queen Victoria Photo" title="Harriet Tubman Lace Shawl Queen Victoria Photo" width=5103 height=6208 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2009_50_39_002_tubman-lace-shawl.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Silk lace and linen shawl given to Harriet Tubman by Queen Victoria, ca. 1897.; Photo: Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of Charles L.

The photograph shows Tubman as a vital, energetic woman capable of wading through swamps and braving the threat of enslave-catchers to lead others to freedom. The photograph survives because an abolitionist cataloged it along with images of other abolitionists, teachers, and figures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Think of the shawl: 30 years after Tubman saved so many of her people from a horrible fate, Queen Victoria gifts it to Tubman showing her admiration and respect.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The shawl survives because Tubman’s descendants preserved it long enough to present it to a professional bibliophile, Dr. Charles L. Blockson, who thought it worthy to be preserved as a national treasure for the American people. When <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/collection/search?edan_q=blockson&edan_local=1&op=Search" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Blockson donated the shawl and several items to the museum" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dr. Blockson donated the shawl and several items to the museum</a> in 2009, there was not a dry eye in the room as those who attended sang “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” the song Tubman allegedly sang moments before she took her last breath. Nearly 100 years after her burial, the staff at the museum and everyone present for the donation, felt a special connection to Tubman that day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nmaahc.si.edu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Museum of African American History and Culture" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">National Museum of African American History and Culture</a> in Washington, D.C., is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture. The Museum’s nearly 40,000 objects help all Americans see how their stories, their histories, and their cultures are shaped by a people’s journey and a nation’s story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJon5qqop6ytXnTrpmmmZ5irrPAyJ%2BYnKyjYsawwc2gZKmgn6m8br3UnpynZaaesLW70aKYZquYlsStec2mmJqgkw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
