The first 20 minutes of this film are so informed with tenderness and sympathy, that all of the rest, after the plot gets going, seems unworthy of it.</p><p>If Forbes had told the story of his old lady just as he began, "The Whisperers" would have been a masterpiece. Instead, it is a very good film marred by unfortunate melodrama. This was also a problem with two other good films by Forbes, "The L-Shaped Room'' and "Whistle Down the Wind," in which he could not quite allow his subjects to lead their own lives.</p><p>But this is not his failing alone. For years we have been brainwashed into expecting "significance" and "a story" every time we go to the movies. Only occasionally does a director reject conventional plots and melodramatic adventures in order to give us all of the depth of common human life. Satyajit Ray's splendid "<a href=#>The Big City</a>," which closed at the Hyde Park after only a week's run, was such a film. "The Whisperers" could have been another.</p><p>Still, it is well worth seeing exactly as it is because of the superb performance by Dame Edith. She is a beautiful woman and a great actress. <a href=#>Eric Portman</a> plays her husband, reunited with her after a long separation, and brings a delicate mixture of pride, anger and diffidence to their marriage relationship.</p><p>I wish Forbes had been content simply to work out the conflicts between those two people and the daily threats of poverty and old age. Instead, he inserted some cops and robbers. They serve the purpose of bringing the old lady briefly into the outside world. But at the end of the film, abandoned once again by her husband, she is still peeking into corners and whispering, "Are you there?" And those private fears are really what the film is about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lp522tLzEq5yrq11mhneE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
