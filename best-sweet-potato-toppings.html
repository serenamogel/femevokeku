Maybe you need some Vitamin A (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Insider</a>, a sweet potato has 2,300% of your daily value of Vitamin A; a regular potato has 0%). Maybe you have a sweet tooth and “sweet” anything with dinner sounds like a good idea. Or maybe you just absolutely love sweet potatoes and want to find the best sweet potato toppings so you and your favorite veg can live happily ever after. Those are all valid reasons for seeking out the best toppings for sweet potatoes! We rounded up some bangers from our rankings, and whether you like your sweet potatoes savory or you really like to lean into their sweetness, we have you covered.</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Local Hive Raw & Unfiltered Honey SoCal</a></strong><p>If you’re the type of person who always loads up on your grandma’s mini marshmallow-strewn sweet potato casserole at Thanksgiving dinner, this pick is for you. Pair some <a href=#>good salted butter</a> with this raw honey straight from the lips of happy Southern California bees (no, bees probably don’t have lips, but stay with me here). We tried a lot of lackluster honey during our extensive honey taste test, but this Local Hive honey was anything but bland. According to Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a>, “It’s incredibly versatile, balancing sweetness with floral notes and herbal notes.” Honey and butter are a god-tier combo, especially on a sweet tater—and this honey is among the best you can buy.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best honey</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>A Dozen Cousins Cuban Black Beans&nbsp;</a></strong><p>If savory sides are more your vibe, load up your sweet potatoes with these cumin-spiced black beans from A Dozen Cousins. These beautiful beans come fully seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and smoky, flavorful cumin, so all you have to do is heat them up and top your tater. The best toppings for sweet potatoes (hell, the best toppings for anything) are ones that save you time, so set aside your bland-ass beans and opt for the preseasoned kind.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best black beans</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Wallaby Aussie Greek Style Plain</a></strong><p>A big ol’ dollop of Greek yogurt adds creaminess and tang to pretty much anything, so, naturally, it makes our list of the best sweet potato toppings, especially if you go the savory route. Take it from our taste testers: Wallaby Aussie Greek Style Plain Greek yogurt is really, really good. It’s ultra-smooth and has an excellent full-fat flavor that makes even a basic baked sweet potato taste rich and indulgent. Throw this on top of the savory potato you created with those smoky, seasoned black beans (see #2), and dinner’s done, dude.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best Greek yogurt</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Blue Elephant Thai Premium Red Curry Sauce</a></strong><p>If you want a cheat code to a delicious sweet potato curry, use Blue Elephant Thai Premium Red Curry Sauce as one of your sweet potato toppings. Blue Elephant makes “restaurant quality” sauces (their words, not mine, though Sporked senior writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> agreed), so just drizzle this over your sweet potato and you’ll be tricked into thinking you got takeout from your favorite curry spot. The earthiness of the sweet potato balances out the delicate heat of the curry, so you really can’t go wrong here.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best red curry sauce</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nueske’s Applewood Smoked Bacon</strong></a><p>Everyone knows bacon bits are an essential baked potato topping, but, whatever you do, don’t snooze on bacon as a sweet potato topping. We’re recommending Nueske’s bacon for this job because it’s so smoky and deeply savory, which makes it a perfect complement to a sweet potato. Crumbled up as a sweet potato topping, these nice, thick slices of bacon will add some chew, too. And then you can use the rest for breakfast the next morning—brilliant.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best bacon</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv9aenK1loKTBosDOZquoqKCeu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
