On October 11, 2022, it was announced that returning judges Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson will be joined by newcomers Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.</p><p>Niall’s presence has sparked a lot of excitement among listeners of his music and viewers of the show because he was one of the most well-liked members of the now-defunct boy band One Direction.</p><p>The former are interested in what he will do, while the latter is curious about who he is.</p><h2>Who is Niall on The Voice?</h2><p>Niall is one of the four judges on the NBC singing competition The Voice. Niall also has a successful career as a musician.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Niall-on-The-Voice.jpg><p>The singer began his career in 2010 and got his start on a reality competition series; he was born on September 13, 1993, in Mullingar, Westmeath, Ireland. Niall joined One Direction after appearing in the British music competition The X Factor.</p><p><strong>Check out more details we have covered related to The Voice Season 22 and23:</strong></p><h2>How did Niall become The Voice’s Judge?</h2><p>Niall is a member of The Voice’s judging panel. Judges Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, and Chance the Rapper join Niall.</p><p>In contrast to many other singing reality competition series, the judges on The Voice not only provide feedback on each contestant’s performance but also form a team of their choosing and coach them throughout the season.</p><p>The number of members on the team ranges from three to five, depending on how many people made it past the first round of testing. At the beginning of the presentation, the judges will have their backs on the candidate while listening to them; if they like what they hear, they can press a button on their chairs to turn around and offer the person an invitation to join their team.</p><p>Niall’s unorthodox ploy to win over candidate Ross Clayton is a big reason why he’s been in the news so much recently. The performer just walked up to each chair and touched the button again, turning the judges around.</p><h2>What Did Niall Do Before Coming to The Voice?</h2><p>Former member of the boy band One Direction with Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik. Boys from One Direction formed a band.</p><p>They tried out for the X Factor individually, but no one was successful. Yet veteran judge Simon Cowell recognized their collective potential and brought them together.</p><p>One Direction enjoyed widespread acclaim as a group from 2011 to 2016. The group’s legion of young female fans was known as the Directioners. However, the band broke up less than a year following Zayn’s departure on March 25, 2015, and each member has since focused on a solo career.</p><p>If you wanted to know any other details relating to The Voice you can tell us in the comment section.
