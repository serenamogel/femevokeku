They’re flaky. They’re tender.

Basically, the best store bought biscuit should be all things to all people.</p><p>Biscuits are one of my desert island foods. They are so delicious, affordable, and versatile. I could eat them for every meal and never grow tired of them. And, believe it or not, I typically prefer a store bought biscuit to a homemade biscuit. There’s something about the ease and familiarity of a canned or frozen biscuit that feels comforting to me.</p><p>Over the course of two taste tests, we tried every store bought biscuit we could get our hands on. They were all good, but some were truly great. Scroll to find out which store bought biscuits (including canned biscuits, biscuit mix, and even gluten free biscuits) I’ll be buying from here on out.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best gluten free biscuits" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-10.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Gluten Free</p><strong>Red Lobster Gluten Free Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Obviously gluten free biscuits are not as good as regular biscuits. If you follow a gluten free diet, however, this mix makes the best gluten free biscuits. They’re relatively moist, have a nice crumble, and don’t have a weird mouthfeel like so many gluten free baked goods. If you slathered these with some butter and jam, I think any member of the celiac squad would you very happy with these.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best canned biscuits" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for a Sandwich</p><strong>Immaculate Baking Organic Flaky Biscuits</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>The label doesn’t lie. These biscuits looked immaculate when they came out of the oven. They have tons of beautiful layers and are super doughy and buttery. They would be superb for a biscuit breakfast sandwich because they break in half easily and have a lot of surface area. For some reason, I did not have high hopes for these biscuits. I owe you an apology, Immaculate Baking.

All you have to do is add a little H2O and you have freshly baked biscuits?! Incredible. I can’t believe science has come this far.

Sure, I would put a drizzle of honey or a smear of marmalade onto one, but I don’t think of biscuits themselves as being sweet. Pillsbury Grands! Southern Homestyle Honey Butter Biscuits changed my mind about sweet biscuits. These are delicious. Not only are they sweet, they have a distinct honey flavor. In terms of the best store bought biscuits, these are absolutely the best sweet option we tried.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best store bought biscuits" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Frozen</p><strong>Pillsbury Grands! Southern Style Frozen Breakfast Biscuits</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>My Southern family has always sworn by frozen biscuits because they’re perfect for anyone who wants a biscuit with every meal. It’s so easy to just toss one or two into a toaster oven and have a hot, freshly baked biscuit in no time—unlike canned biscuits, which take a little longer to cook up. These frozen biscuits from Pillsbury are super crusty on the outside and have a nice rise. If you want easy biscuits, these are the best store bought biscuits for you.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best canned biscuits" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Kroger Butter Flavored Ready-to-Bake Jumbo Biscuits</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>Kroger’s butter-flavored jumbo biscuits feel like the younger siblings of the Great Value jumbo biscuits (our number two best store bought biscuits). They are very similar, but the Kroger biscuits are a little smaller and a little less buttery than their Walmart branded rivals. That being said, they still taste incredible and share many of the same wonderful qualities, like a fluffy interior, crunchy exterior, and rich flavor. If Kroger is more your jam than Walmart, these will absolutely scratch the buttery-store-bought-biscuit itch.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Credit: Liv Averett / Ralphs</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="biscuit mix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Boxed Mix</p><strong>Red Lobster Rosemary Parmesan Biscuit Mix</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I know.

They taste like the classic Cheddar Bay Biscuits with a hint of rosemary. It’s so fragrant and the herb is a wonderful complement to the cheddar flavor. This is the best biscuit mix we tried and one of the best store bought biscuits in general. Skip the original, buy this mix. You’ll thank me.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="store bought biscuits" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Buttery</p><strong>Great Value Butter Flavor Jumbo Biscuits</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>When Great Value says butter flavor, they mean butter flavor. These biscuits have chunks of butter heavily peppered throughout the dough that turn into pockets of hot, melted butter when they cook. If that doesn’t sell you on these biscuits, you need to talk about that with your therapist. The biscuits are large. They’re buttery without being greasy. You do not need to add a single thing to these biscuits before consuming them. I mean, you could. It would be great! But these are the only store bought biscuits on the list I would happily eat totally plain.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best store bought biscuit" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANKING-UPDATE_BISCUIT_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Pillsbury Grands!

When you bake them, they get nice and tall. The outside is crusty, while the inside remains soft and fluffy. They simply melt in your mouth. Their flavor is buttery but light, which makes them the perfect vehicle for butter, jam, and honey. They also have a sturdy exterior that makes a solid biscuit sandwich filled with fried chicken, <a href=#>pimento cheese</a>, or sausage and egg.
