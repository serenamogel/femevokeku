Words like "sagging," "dull," "hollow," and "wrinkly" are commonly used to market skincare to women in this age group. But the reality is, signs of aging are marks of life experiences that younger generations aren't in on — yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These skin-related changes are largely due in part to perimenopause, the years leading up to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>menopause</a> where estrogen hormones start to drop off, which causes the skin to become thinner and lose elasticity. Reduced collagen production is a factor as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your 40s are also the time when years of unprotected sun exposure may start to catch up with you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If your skin has not been protected, significant dyspigmentation (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sunspots</a>, seborrheic keratoses, melasma) may appear, and in those truly indulgent in sun rays, precancerous spots called actinic keratoses, wrinkles, and textural changes may appear," says Dr. Melanie Palm, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Art of Skin MD</a> in San Diego, CA.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you want to switch up your routine to address fine lines that have gotten deeper, target uneven skin tone, or boost hydration, the right skincare routine is whatever products make you feel good about your skin at this stage of your life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To help guide you in finding the best skincare routine, we spoke with Dr. Palm and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Corey L. Hartman</a>, founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, AL, for their expert tips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-morning-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Morning Routine</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every good skincare routine starts with washing your face. Dr. Palm recommends using a cleanser that offers gentle exfoliation and anti-aging benefits — think AHA acids, plant-derived enzymes, or even fermented ingredients.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cleanser</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're fans of Kinship's Naked Papaya Gentle Enzyme Cleanser, a gentle foaming cleanser infused with plant-based brightening enzymes and skin barrier-supporting ingredients.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$23; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">credobeauty.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Serums</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, both dermatologists agree that using a specific serum is an important step. "An antioxidant serum containing a cocktail of vitamins — most popular are vitamin C, vitamin E, ferulic acid, resveratrol, and niacinamide — helps to guard against free radical development that causes degradation of precious collagen," Dr. Hartman explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Skinceuticals C E Ferulic is the gold standard of antioxidant serums. This formula is often recommended by dermatologists and beauty editors alike because it contains vitamins C, E, and ferulic acid to protect against environmental damage caused by free radicals. The multitasking serum also treats signs of aging and photodamage such as fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$169; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">skinceuticals.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Epi.logic Master Plan Collagen Renew Growth Factor Serum is a physician-created formula that includes peptides, human stem cell-derived epidermal growth factors, hyaluronic acid to repair and promote cell turnover to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, enhance collagen production for firmness, and help maintain skin's hydration.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$210; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">epilogicskincare.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Moisturizer</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for moisturizers, look for a formula that contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, squalane, and glycerin.

La Roche-Posay Toleraine Double Repair Face Moisturizer is a non-greasy formula with glycerin, niacinamide, and ceramides to hydrate and soothe all skin types.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$20; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">laroche-posay.us</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Eye Cream</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A good eye cream that depuffs and hydrates the eye area, and a collagen-boosting product like a TriHex peptide cream or growth factor serum are also great additions to a morning skincare routine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$90; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">alastin.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sunscreen</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sunscreen is the final and most important step in every morning skincare routine. Both MDs recommend a mineral SPF with zinc oxide and antioxidants to support protection against environmental pollution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A good skincare regimen means absolutely nothing without a broad-spectrum sunscreen, preferably mineral-based, physical containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide," says Dr. Hartman. "Add a tint to ensure that iron oxides are included to protect against high energy visible (blue) light."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">EltaMD UV Daily Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 40 is an award-winning sunscreen with zinc oxide.

So firstly, it's important to remove any makeup you're wearing. Dr. Hartman likes micellar water or alcohol-free toner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water is an affordable drugstore buy that simultaneously removes makeup and cleanses skin — even waterproof makeup.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$11; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">garnier.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Exfoliator</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Palm recommends exfoliating with a gommage, a product that combines gentle chemical and physical exfoliation, after cleansing. "A good cleanser followed by a gommage is my go-to for skin in my 40s," she says. "Gommages gently exfoliate the skin without a chemical or physical irritant."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And don't let the word "peel" in Odacité's Bioactive Rose Gommage fool you. This mild gel can be used as a traditional exfoliating mask. Apply a thin layer to the face, and roll it off under your fingers right before it's fully dry. You'll be able to see the product falling away.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$62; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">nordstrom.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Retinol</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Retinol is the star active ingredient of nighttime skincare routines. "The holy grail ingredient is retinol which helps regulate exfoliation, prevent acne breakouts, smooth the skin's surface, and even out discoloration," says Dr. Hartman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">L'Oréal Paris Derm Intensives Night Serum With 0.3% Retinol is another drugstore buy that would cover your retinol needs. It contains the most potent form of the ingredient and works on deep wrinkles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Palm recommends boosting prescription retinoid creams with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">bakuchiol product</a>, an Asian botanical rich in vitamin A. "The plant and seeds are used in skincare and up-regulate retinol receptors and can enhance retinoid effects while decreasing redness and irritancy," she explains.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$40: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>loreal.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Moisturizer</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moisturizer is an important last step to replenishing skin and reinforcing the skin barrier. "Choose one rich in emollients, but with active ingredients to encourage skin repair – again peptides and growth factors are a good choice," says Dr. Palm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drunk Elephant's Protini Polypeptide Cream is a rich (but not too greasy) moisturizer formulated with a blend of nine peptides, growth factors, and amino acids to improve the skin's texture and tone on top of adding hydration.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$68; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sephora.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-add-ons></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_96-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Add-Ons</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Based on your skin type, opt for a hydrating or clarifying face mask once a week. "The former for dry skin types that are prone to irritation and the latter for oily skin that deals with acne," says Dr. Hartman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_99-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The formula you choose can also vary based on the season. "During winter, a hydrating weekly mask is great for parched skin that is aggravated by plunging temperatures and humidity levels," Dr. Palm suggests. She says many formulas can be rubbed down to the neck and left on overnight for extra hydration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On sunny days, try a brightening mask. "Topical agents such as tranexamic acid, vitamin C, E, mushroom extract, azelaic acid, or arbutin would be great hero ingredients to be on the lookout for when selecting the right mask," says Dr. Palm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_103-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for devices, both dermatologists recommend a microcurrent device. Just know that if you do opt to try one, it takes consistent use to see results. "I do caution patients that consistency is needed," Dr. Palm shares. "These devices can be helpful, but it requires incorporating a few minutes of use nightly into your skincare routine, which is sometimes hard to do when balancing professional and family responsibilities."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_105-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">NuFace is by far the most popular microcurrent device on the market. The Trinity Facial Toning Device stimulates the surface of the skin with microcurrents to improve the face's contour, firmness, and smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_108-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$339; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">nuface.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_110-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-and-keep-in-mind-stronger-isnt-always-better></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_114-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>And Keep in Mind, Stronger Isn't Always Better</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_115-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a common misconception that the deeper the forehead line, the stronger the product needs to be in order to see results -- that's not always the case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_117-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The titration of certain ingredients should always be guided solely by skin type, concern, and goals," says Dr. Hartman.
