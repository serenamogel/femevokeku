Antonio Campos is directing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Campos, along with his brother, Paulo, wrote the screenplay.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a hard book to adapt also because there was so much that we loved," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Antonio told Entertainment Weekly</a>. "I’m a big fan of Southern Gothic and noir and this was a perfect marriage of the two. Sometimes, you might be adapting a piece and you think, like, 'Well, there is a seed of a good idea here and I'll just throw everything away and start from scratch.' In this case, it was like, we love everything!”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is The Devil All the Time even about?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix's official synopsis</a> of the new movie:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In Knockemstiff, Ohio and its neighboring backwoods, sinister characters — an unholy preacher (Robert Pattinson), twisted couple (Jason Clarke and Riley Keough), and a crooked sheriff (Sebastian Stan) — converge around young Arvin Russell (Tom Holland) as he fights the evil forces that threaten him and his family. Spanning the time between World War II and the Vietnam war, director Antonio Campos' The Devil All the Time renders a seductive and horrific landscape that pits the just against the corrupted."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scanlen elaborated, saying that the film deals with faith and family. She also explained the film's arduous filming schedule.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This film is about the ways people struggle with their faith, and how they define faith for themselves and what it leads them to do. We see in this film very extreme depictions of this struggle," Scanlen told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a>. "It was only a 10-day shoot, but it was filled to the brim with really tricky scenes and a really tricky storyline to fill amongst other people's storylines. It was definitely a test in stamina."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Netflix</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is The Devil All the Time based on?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Donald Ray Pollock's debut novel of the same name was described as a "blood-soaked noir" by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a>. According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>, which reviewed the book back in 2011, it's a dark, dark story — the opening scene is a crucifixion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The story begins with the return of a veteran, Willard Russell, from the Pacific island abattoir of World War II, where he has seen a fellow soldier skinned and crucified alive," the paper's review reads. "He carries this vision home, but as the novel proceeds and the lives of Willard's mother, his uncle, and especially his son carry forward, the Russell clan is beset on all sides by nightmares the equal of anything Willard experienced in combat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the novel is set in Ohio and West Virginia, the film was shot in Alabama.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a challenging shoot just because there were so many locations and we were really spread out over a large portion of northern Alabama," Antonio <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">told EW</a>. "The nice thing is Alabama hasn’t been filmed in very often, so it’s not as recognizable as some other places that have been filmed in and photographed thoroughly by various films and TV shows."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is there a trailer?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Netflix released a trailer on August 13, 2020, about a month before the movie's debut.

"He just didn't want to do it. He was just adamant about figuring it out on his own. He would be like, 'I'm going to do this thing and that thing, with a little bit of this.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the first day of shooting, Campos said, Pattinson revealed his high-pitched accent for the first time — which Campos gave him full reign on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't get worried about those things," the director said. "There was no way in my mind that he wasn't going to come on set with something bad. I might not have dug it, but it wasn't going to be bad. I'd rather have someone come with something weird that's a choice than something that isn't thought out. So I knew he would come with something interesting."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeemsGnuMixZK2glWKxpsLIpWSapJxiwamxjK2gpp0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
