Whether you’re looking for frozen Italian meatballs, frozen Swedish meatballs, or frozen meatballs ready-to-eat in marinara sauce, we tasted a bunch and found the best frozen meatballs to buy at a grocery store near you.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of multiple ball-tastic taste tests, we tried lots and lots and lots of different types of frozen meatballs and 11 stood out above the rest. In this list, you’ll find not only classic pork and beef meatballs, but also the top performers in both our frozen turkey meatballs-specific taste test and our frozen vegan meatballs taste test.&nbsp;</p><p>So what are the best frozen meatballs and what are we, the Sporked team, looking for in the best frozen meatball? Well, we want to taste meat (yes, even if it’s a vegan meatball). Too many meatballs out there taste like they’re filled with grain and miscellaneous fodder. Secondly, we like a soft, tender meatball. Meatballs shouldn’t be overly dense or tightly packed. Additional flavor notes like herbs and aromatics are fully welcome, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get into our ranking. Here are the best rated frozen meatballs to buy, according to our taste testers.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best frozen turkey meatballs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-MEATBALLS_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Turkey (Runner-Up)</strong></p><strong>Applegate Well Carved Organic Mediterranean Style Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>These aren’t traditional frozen meatballs by any stretch of the imagination. They’re made of turkey and they feature dill. “These wouldn’t be the star of the show,” said Sporked senior staff writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a>, “but maybe with some pickles, some pita, some tzatziki sauce, it could work.” Jordan’s got the right idea. These frozen turkey meatballs are a great alternative to a beef or pork meatball, but don’t go throwing any red sauce on them, and definitely don’t serve them with pasta. Honestly, I would love to take some pita bread, wrap these bad boys up with some lettuce and some labneh, and go to town. They’re the best frozen turkey meatballs to sub in for falafel at home. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Ryan Martin / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best frozen meatballs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-MEATBALLS_INSET-08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best with Alfredo</p><strong>Kroger Flame Broiled Homestyle</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Kroger</a><p>The packaging would lead you to expect these frozen meatballs are marked with grill lines. They are not. You also might expect them to be smoke-kissed. They are not. But they’re still some of the best frozen meatballs to buy. They’re made with a mix of chicken along with pork and beef, but the chicken is the most prominent flavor. If you’re trying to cut out red meat but can’t quite go cold turkey (or chicken), these are a great option. They’re slightly heartier than all-chicken frozen meatballs.

Again, the problem with most frozen meatballs is that they don’t taste like meat. But that’s not a problem here. These Angus meatballs are beefy and tender. You can just tell the quality is higher than your average store-bought frozen meatball. But, while the beef is good, these meatballs lack some seasoning. That said, they’re not beyond saving. And the fact that they go light on the seasoning makes them some of the best frozen meatballs to toss with a spicy <a href=#>red sauce</a> for some extra kick. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Ryan Martin / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Signature Select Turkey Meatballs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-MEATBALLS_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Turkey Meatballs</p><strong>Signature Select Turkey Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Vons</a><p>These store-brand frozen turkey meatballs (find them at Albertsons-owned grocery stores) are the best frozen turkey meatballs we’ve tried. While turkey on its own doesn’t have a ton of flavor, these are seasoned with garlic and onion and parsley, and you can actually taste all of those aromatics in the mix. Plus, they have just the right texture. These may not be the best tasting frozen meatballs overall, but they’re the number one pick for you if you’re looking for turkey and only turkey. — Justine Sterling</p><p>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best frozen turkey meatballs</a></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-0957cec8d361c71094466cc841d4ef4d">Credit: Liv Averett / Vons</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best frozen swedish meatballs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-MEATBALLS_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Swedish</p><strong>Kroger Swedish</strong> <strong>Style Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Kroger</a><p>Kroger’s frozen Swedish meatballs are the best frozen Swedish meatballs. Yes, they’re better than Ikea’s Swedish meatballs. I’m afraid of the ire I might inspire by saying that, but I stand by it. They’re small but not mini with a smooth texture inside that’s contrasted by tasty crispness on the outside. These take the title of best frozen Swedish meatballs over Ikea’s because they’re much more savory—not just salty, but savory with lots of umami flavor. They would be absolutely killer paired with some tangy lingonberry jam (which you’ll probably need to get from Ikea, sorry). — Justine Sterling</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-111e1b4452093d2e44b73ff32c5d0bb1">Credit: Liv Averett / Kroger</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="rao's frozen meatballs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-MEATBALLS_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Meatball Sandwich</p><strong>Rao’s Meatballs & Sauce</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Albertsons</a><p>These frozen meatballs don’t pack a whole lot of flavor, but, man, the size is great and they’re really soft and tender. They’re made with beef and pork, but in my opinion, the ratio of breadcrumbs to meat is a little off. But that’s all made up for because these frozen meatballs come sauced in a pool of that delicious, liquid gold that is Rao’s homemade marinara (our <a href=#>top marinara sauce</a>). Pop this tray in the oven or nuke it in the microwave, then nestle the meatballs and sauce in a hoagie bun or a crusty french baguette to make a delicious meatball sandwich. That’s what I think these are the best frozen meatballs for, although there is enough sauce in the package for a serving or two of pasta. If you want to make a meatball sub without putting in a lot of effort, this is the best frozen meatball for you. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Ryan Martin / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best frozen meatballs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-MEATBALLS_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Herby</p><strong>Farm Rich Italian Style Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>instacart</a><p>These frozen Italian meatballs from Farm Rich are herbaceous and juicy, and they’re a good size to boot.

There’s this oddly specific, pepper jack cheese flavor in the mix, and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m positive you’ll also taste it. It’s not red pepper flakes, mind you—these frozen meatballs have more of a cheesy, spicy fruitiness that our palates associate with pepper jack cheese. They’re made with beef only (no pork), parmesan cheese, onion, garlic, and spices, and the mellow heat actually works. They’re definitely not the most Italian-tasting things in the world, but they still provide enough flavor to warrant a pickup on your next TJ’s run.

Try them in a sub, topped with peppers and onions as if you were eating an Italian sausage at a ball game.

Quite frankly, Kirkland puts every other meatball to shame with its deliciously fatty, spicy, porky flavor. There’s some noticeable black pepper flavor, and the meatballs are salted well, too. In my opinion, all you really need to make great meatballs is a nice blend of beef and pork, salt, and pepper. Kirkland proves that.
