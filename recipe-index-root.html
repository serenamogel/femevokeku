Smoky BBQ tofu plays off a tangy, nutty cabbage salad, which in turn contrasts with sour dill pickles, creamy avocado, and a soft, sweet bun. When it comes to plant-based cookout or game day recipes, it‚Äôs a tough one to beat. This tofu sandwich is bold, hearty, and seriously saucy. I learned the hard way: don‚Äôt attempt to eat it without a stack of napkins nearby.

Early on, this surprised me, because eggplant recipes have always been some of my favorite foods to eat. As a kid, I never wanted to stop playing at dinnertime, except when my mom was making eggplant Parmesan. And when I started to explore vegetarian cooking on my own, grilled eggplant was one of the first dishes I mastered. But if I‚Äôve learned one thing through writing Love and Lemons, it‚Äôs that not everyone likes eggplant. I‚Äôve heard it called spongy, bitter, and bland, and to that I‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Do you have an opinion about corn pizza? Love it? Hate it? Never tried it? I‚Äôm firmly in the ‚Äúlove it‚Äù camp, and I‚Äôm sharing my favorite corn pizza recipe in the hopes of winning more folks over. Of all the pizza toppings out there, sweet corn is seriously underrated. The reason it‚Äôs so good is its texture. The lightly crisp, juicy kernels offer a delicious contrast to creamy cheese and starchy crust. They add an unexpected sweetness to a pizza as well. This white corn pizza really shows these qualities off. I pair the corn with lemony ricotta, melty‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Fresh tomato recipes go on repeat in our house every summer. In the dead of winter, there‚Äôs nothing I crave more than a summer tomato‚Äîsweet, juicy, and ripe. The out-of-season supermarket ones can‚Äôt compare, so when summer rolls around, I only have a few months to make every tomato salad, sandwich, pasta, and pizza I‚Äôve imagined throughout the year. When I made my grocery list this morning, I added cherry tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, and&nbsp;tomatoes on the vine. We have lots of tomato recipes on tap this week. üôÇ I hope you‚Äôre also cooking with tomatoes like crazy right now, while‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It‚Äôs zucchini season! Bring on the zucchini recipes! Partway through July every summer, I start to feel like I‚Äôve cooked all the zucchini recipes out there. I‚Äôve made zucchini bread and zucchini fritters, grilled zucchini and baked zucchini chips. This week, I looked at my market haul of summer squash and asked, ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù. If you‚Äôre in a similar spot right now, I have good news: zucchini is one versatile veggie. It tastes fantastic in pastas, tacos, salads, and even chocolate cake! You can grill it, bake it, saut√© it, and also eat it raw. We might feel like we‚Äôve‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This zucchini fritters recipe is the perfect thing to make when you have a surplus of summer squash in the fridge. It calls for a full pound of zucchini, about 3 medium. But it‚Äôs so tasty that if you happen to have even more&nbsp;zucchini than that on hand (and at this time of year, you might), you probably won‚Äôt mind making it again and polishing off another batch of zucchini fritters the next day. These zucchini fritters are crispy on the outside and light and tender in the middle.

This yummy recipe is a fun way to change up your weeknight pasta rotation, because even though it looks like pasta with marinara, it tastes like something else entirely. The red pepper pasta sauce is lightly creamy, tangy, and filled with sweet and smoky flavor. Sun-dried tomatoes make it deeply savory, and basil adds a refreshing kick. If you‚Äôve been stuck in a pasta rut lately, I hope you‚Äôll try this recipe. This roasted red pepper pasta is simple, unexpected, and nothing if not flavorful. It‚Äôs the perfect‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I‚Äôll never turn down fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce for dipping, but they especially hit the spot on hot summer days. Served cold or at room temperature, they‚Äôre cooling and refreshing, stuffed with noodles, tofu, veggies, and fragrant herbs. The sweet and savory dipping sauce takes them over the top. I‚Äôve ordered fresh Vietnamese spring rolls countless times at restaurants, but if I think to snag a pack of rice paper wrappers at the store, I make my own at home. I can‚Äôt call them 100% authentic because I love to experiment with different ingredients in the filling (mango?‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>You can make this BBQ tofu recipe in two ways: in the oven or on the grill. The oven version is an easy protein for vegetarian dinners all year round, while the grilled BBQ tofu is perfect for summer cookouts. I‚Äôve loved making it for our backyard get-togethers lately because it‚Äôs a) super simple to make, b) bursting with BBQ flavor, and c) a hit with everyone, tofu skeptics included! This BBQ tofu has a satisfying chewy texture with edges that are crisp and lightly charred. A glossy layer of BBQ sauce coats each cube, giving it an amazing sweet,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This burrito recipe happens to be vegan, but you don‚Äôt have to be vegan to love it. It‚Äôs easy to make, it‚Äôs flavorful and fresh, and you can even meal prep it if you want to get ahead on lunch or dinner. The hearty filling consists of Spanish rice, seasoned black beans, guacamole, pickled onions, and veggies. Take it over the top with a side of salsa for dipping! Below, I‚Äôll walk you through how to make this vegan burrito recipe, offer tips for how to store it, and share some tasty variations.

On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our table with a colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I‚Äôd rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect lunch or dinner: they‚Äôre simple to toss together, but they‚Äôre super flavorful nonetheless.
