This represents the direct correlation between the Load Line Calibration and how the processor/motherboard deals with voltage requests while under load. &nbsp;This is not to be confused with the quality of power delivery, but more an indication of how aggressive the default LLC settings are on a motherboard.<a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5793/ASUSP8Z77-VProVoltageRipple_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The ASUS board has regular power delivery, with minimal voltage ripple under load.</p><p><strong>Overclocking</strong></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Ivy Bridge does not overclock like Sandy Bridge.&nbsp; For a detailed report on the effect of voltage on Ivy Bridge (and thus temperatures and power draw), please read <a href=#>Undervolting and Overclocking on Ivy Bridge</a>.</p><p>ASUS overclocking tools have been consistent over the few previous chipsets.&nbsp; In the BIOS, OC Tuner is a simple setting that enables a ‘Fast’ overclock on the system.&nbsp; Similarly, the TPU button on board does a similar action.&nbsp; In the OS, the TurboV Evo part of the software offers ‘Fast’ and ‘Extreme’ auto overclocking modes.&nbsp; For manual overclocking, the TurboV Evo software allows the user to play with an overclock in the OS, which should aid in setting a more permanent overclock in the BIOS.</p><p><strong>Auto Overclock: ‘</strong>Fast’ mode (either through BIOS or OS) implements an immediate 19% overclock, with 41x on the multiplier and 102 MHz base frequency, ending with 4182 MHz overall.&nbsp; This is coupled with a memory overclock, which in my case it did XMP but backed off one memory strap.&nbsp; What was odd was that the memory was set to a 3T command rate!</p><p>‘Extreme’ mode implements a algorithmic testing tool in the OS to probe overclock limits.&nbsp; By slowly upping the multiplier and voltage, the system performs stability tests until the system crashes.&nbsp; The system reboots and then implements BCLK tuning, while still monitoring temperatures.&nbsp; In our test, the initial boot implemented a 20% overclock at 41x103 (4223 MHz), and then performed multiplier testing.&nbsp; At 47x, the system restarted to 46x and started BCLK tuning.&nbsp; At 104.5 MHz, the system restarted again, do a ‘Failed Overclock’ screen on boot.&nbsp; After pressing F1 for Setup, then F10 for Save and Exit, the operating system showed an overall 36% overclock – 46x103.8 (4774 MHz).&nbsp; At load, this gave 1.280 volts at load, giving an immense 94ºC peak temperature during PovRay.&nbsp; I do not think I would be happy with that temperature for a daily system.</p><p><strong>Manual Overclock</strong>: With the overclock performance of Ivy Bridge processors being highly limited by temperature, having a low voltage is key along with hope that it does not compromise the overclock.&nbsp; In this case, I have started with 1.100 volts on the CPU and adjusting only the CPU multiplier to see what stable overclock we can get, before upping the voltage further.&nbsp; For this, PLL Overvoltage was also enabled.</p><p>At 1.100 volts, the highest multiplier that was stable was 45x, giving 4.5 GHz.&nbsp; This gave 68ºC at load with PovRay.</p><p>At 1.150 volts, the highest multiplier that was stable was 46x, giving 4.6 GHz.&nbsp; This gave 76ºC at load with PovRay.</p><p>At 1.200 volts, the highest multiplier that was stable was 47x, giving 4.7 GHz.&nbsp; This gave 83ºC with PovRay and 86ºC with OCCT.&nbsp; The system did boot at 48x, but gave 94ºC under PovRay as well as memory errors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJ4hZJooKeslaF6u4OWZqSorJiav6O7wKubZqqVq7amw4ywoK2gXZ7DunnBq6Cdn5VirrS%2BzpyiZpmjqsBus8igmJuxpJp6orrDZqSsoV9r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
