But for a movie that already lacks the pep it advertised with its colorful, Little Richard-driven opening, watching all the various lessons of Caleb’s life fall apart as it goes into the third act becomes especially laborious; that Frieder doesn’t make anything particularly wise with his bloated roster of good supporting actors&nbsp;makes it worse. For a story that already struggles to apply enough&nbsp;tension into its titular plot device, these extraneous conflicts have little effect. It takes away from the movie’s potential emotional sweetness, when it already relies on so many cliches and expected situations.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>It’s a shame that there are so many weak moments to the story, as it does have standout elements of warmth, directed related to its performances. Kalra, previously seen in&nbsp;the <a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a> movie “<a href=#>Blinded by the Light</a>,” has a couple of strong emotional beats that give depth to a docile character who approaches his own question with shame. And the scenes with Caleb’s support group can be endearing too, led by a doctor (<a href=#>Javier Muñoz</a>) who welcomes Caleb in and helps keep him calm.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Written and directed by <a href=#>Jared Frieder</a>, “Three Months” proves to be an awfully wobbly star vehicle for singer-YouTube star&nbsp;Sivan, in his first major leading role after a supporting part in 2018's&nbsp;"<a href=#>Boy Erased</a>." Part of the problem here&nbsp;comes from the character, whose own personality can only be surmised in try-hard snarky dialogue or his vintage t-shirt collection. We even learn that Caleb’s dreams involve going to Parsons School of Design, though there’s little emphasis on what he'd do there. At the same time, Sivan doesn't yet have a dynamic&nbsp;dramatic presence, even in&nbsp;the vulnerable moments meant to cut through Caleb's tough exterior and make him&nbsp;more relatable.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn6udlWK6sLrToapmpZ%2BrtqZ50Z6top2nYn9xfpE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
