My legs, hands, and elbows become especially dry, and even have the tendency to crack. It’s been that way ever since I can remember, and I’ve tried pretty much every product on the market to bring hydration back to my winter-ravaged skin. It’s been a lost cause — until I discovered the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Body Butter</a>, that is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My 74-year-old mom suffers from dry skin during the winter, too, so she was equally excited to discover this body cream. About a year ago, she was visiting me in Los Angeles and needed a way to moisturize her dry, crepey skin. I recommended this body butter to her, of course, and she picked it up off my coffee table (where it reverently sits). She used it for one day and was already so impressed, she bought a tub that would be waiting for her when she got home the following week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can snag a full eight-ounce size tub <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">at Sephora for $38</a>, or test out a smaller two-ounce version <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">at Amazon for $14</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve both bought the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Body Butter</a> multiple times since trying it, thanks in large part to the fact that it hydrates and nourishes skin like no other we’ve tried. It’s formulated with a host of good-for-the-skin ingredients — including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">100 percent argan oil</a>, of course, which features fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamin E to soften, smooth and moisturize. It also contains shea butter and avocado for extra hydration. The formula is thick, rich, and whipped, and it melts into skin immediately upon contact without leaving behind any greasy residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Sephora, You can choose from four different scents, all of which are divine. I prefer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vanilla Bean</a>, which is sweet and heady without feeling overly cloying. I don’t like when moisturizer scents sit on my skin, and this one dissipates pretty quickly. My mom likes it, too, but she keeps the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">unscented version</a> at home. It’s also available in Sweet Citrus and Vanilla Apricot.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While my mom and I have sung this body cream’s praises from the rooftops for months now, we’re definitely not alone in recognizing its moisturizing prowess. It has 1,000 five-star reviews on Sephora, with shoppers saying it “melts into your skin” and is “easy to absorb.” Other shoppers said skin “looks healthy and refreshed,” “soaks into the skin beautifully,” “doesn’t leave you sticky,” and is “so so hydrating.” The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">6,300 five-star ratings on Amazon</a> are similarly glowing, with shoppers saying it “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">lasts a whole day without reapplying</a>,” “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">leaves skin so soft</a>,” and “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">makes your skin feel like butter</a>.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shoppers in their 60s and 70s particularly love this cream, too. “This is the only moisturizer that I have ever used… that keeps my dry skin silky, smooth and beautifully glowing all day long,” said one <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">74-year-old shopper</a>. A <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">67-year-old shopper</a> with lupus flare-ups said it’s “extremely moisturizing” and helped “calm down the dryness.” And then, of course, there’s the review straight from my mom. “How could just a dab of the Josie Maran body cream make my skin so soft immediately? I love this magical product!,” she raved.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to bring nourishment and hydration back to your skin, the Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Body Butter is absolutely your best bet. Pick up a two-ounce tub for $14 on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon</a> and the larger eight-ounce size for $38 on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sephora</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yaiqop1doq6zrc1mrqGhoKWypXnAq56apl2ktq15waibsmWSqsG1sdFmqZ6umZrEboSTamxpbmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
