Soon enough,&nbsp;Peter Pan (<a href=#>Alexander Molony</a>) makes his entrance from another realm, along with the pint-sized fairy Tinkerbell (<a href=#>Yara Shahidi</a>, of "Black-ish" and "Grown-ish"). They're&nbsp;whisked off to Neverland through a wormhole near the fabled Second Star on the Right. On the other side, they&nbsp;meet and befriend the Lost Boys (seemingly modeled on the Benneton catalog urchins in "Hook") as well as the Native American princess Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanatahk, a member of the Bigstone Cree Nation), who was a pawn-prize-stereotype in the Disney cartoon but gets an&nbsp;action-heroine makeover here, literally riding to the rescue on more than one occasion.</p><p><a href=#>Jude Law</a>, who is settling into his "I'm just here to have a good time!" character-acting phase,&nbsp;anchors the movie as Pan's nemesis&nbsp;Captain Hook. Law&nbsp;plays the character&nbsp;as more of a neurotic comic figure with Personal Issues&nbsp;than a frightening villain (although wee viewers will still want to hide behind furniture when he orders the Darling children put to death). Lowery has given Hook a bit of the Magua or Killmonger villain-as-anti-hero treatment, i.e., making the character's Bad Guy Origin Story so relatable&nbsp;that he seems&nbsp;more pitiable than loathsome.&nbsp;<a href=#>Jim Gaffigan</a>, who's shaping up as a John&nbsp;Goodman-level supporting actor, plays Hook's sidekick Smee as an emotionally bruised,&nbsp;exasperated underling, a schlump&nbsp;who definitely has&nbsp;his faults but is frazzled mainly because he's&nbsp;overwhelmed by having to satisfy a boss who thinks the solution to bad morale is to throw more people overboard. The Peter-Tinkerbell pairing has also been partially re-thought: it's clear that she's the duo's boss, at times seeming to command him psychically, or at least implant suggestions or tasks in his mind in&nbsp;a way that makes him believe he's acting on his own.</p><p>Every performance in this movie is good, sometimes more than good, and little can be said against the filmmaking, which ranges&nbsp;from calendar-art handsome&nbsp;to genuinely inspired (although there's a major problem with one aspect of the lighting/color grading; see below). The action-packed climax, which doubles as a therapy session for major&nbsp;characters, has images of dreamlike eeriness and gives Law a satisfying exit that suits this incarnation of Hook. But the entire thing has a whiff of missed opportunity, and sometimes you might wonder if Lowery and his co-writer <a href=#>Toby Halbrooks</a> wanted to dive&nbsp;deeper than they knew Disney's copyright-tending, merchandise-selling&nbsp;executives&nbsp;would have allowed. There's a truly subversive "Peter Pan"&nbsp;satire to be made from the Peter-Tinkerbell relationship in this one: she's a tiny, mute woman who basically can't get anything done unless she uses a charismatic boy who refuses to grow up&nbsp;as her instrument.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pnK2domK9orqMmqWdZaeau6XFjKamr6GVYr%2BmwsiermZqYGeA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
