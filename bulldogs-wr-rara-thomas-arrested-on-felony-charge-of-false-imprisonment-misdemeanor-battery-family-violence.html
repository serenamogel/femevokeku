He was booked at around 4 a.m. under a felony charge of false imprisonment and a misdemeanor count of family violence battery. He was released on a $1,850 bond shortly after noon.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/r1109777_1296x518_5-2.jpg alt width=1296 height=518 sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px" data-pagespeed-url-hash=3581452751 onload=pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The University of Georgia police arrested Thomas and the Georgia Athletic Department released a statement saying that “the report is disappointing and not reflective of the high standards we have for our student-athletes on and off the field.” This arrest came as a blow to the Georgia team that had just won their second consecutive national championship with a 65-7 rout of TCU on Jan. 9.</p><p>Thomas, who hails from Eufaula, Alabama, was one of Mississippi State’s leading receivers this past season, with 44 catches for a team-high 626 yards and seven touchdowns. He announced his transfer to Georgia in December and was expected to be a key member of the Bulldogs’ offense after receiver Kearis Jackson declared for the NFL draft and receiver Adonai Adonai Mitchell entered the transfer portal.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportszion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1424735681.jpg alt width=795 height=417 sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" data-pagespeed-url-hash=2690620804 onload=pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Mitchell, who later committed to Texas, missed much of the 2022 season with a high ankle sprain but returned in time to make the game-winning, 10-yard touchdown catch against Ohio State in the College Football Playoff semifinal. He added a 22-yard touchdown catch against TCU in the national title game.</p><p>Thomas’s arrest is a major setback for Georgia, and the consequences it may have are yet to be seen. With the Georgia Athletic Department having high standards for their student-athletes, they may take this into account and take necessary disciplinary action. Thomas had been expected to be a vital part of the Bulldogs’ offense, but the team will now have to find a way to carry on without him.</p><p>Despite the arrest of Thomas, the Georgia Bulldogs’ offensive lineup is still looking strong. Thomas’ transfer in December had added to their already impressive offensive arsenal, making them a formidable team going into the 2022 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmm62cobGws9Jmrqtlopa%2FonnToaammaNirrO%2BxKyrnpxdpLtussSlpqexXZi1or7GnmSonl2brq2%2FxGagpqiinsCwusyepa1lnZ7ApbHMnpinp6Jir6LA056psmWWlrqquNhmraKnnJq7pLGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
