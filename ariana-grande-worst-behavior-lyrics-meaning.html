Many are convinced that the song, which was released as a bonus track on the deluxe version of her album Positions, is all about Ari’s fiancé—and it’s easy to see why once you take a look at <a href=# id=auto-tag_ariana-grande data-tag=ariana-grande>Ariana Grande</a>‘s “Worst Behavior” lyrics below.</p><p>Ariana, 27, released the deluxe edition of her sixth studio album on Friday, February 19. The expanded version of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Positions</a>&nbsp;features five new tracks—including a <a href=#>remix of “34+35”</a> featuring Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion, “Test Drive,” “Main Thing,” “Someone Like U (Interlude)” and, of course, “Worst Behavior.” Each of these tracks has fans drawing allusions to <a href=#>Ariana’s fiancé Dalton Gomez</a>, but it’s this latter song that really seems to reveal some details about their relationship.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ariana-grande-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ariana-grande-oscars.png><p>Ariana <a href=#>announced her engagement</a> to the Los Angeles real-estate agent in December 2020 after months of secretly dating and living together. In “Worst Behavior,” Ari finally seems to address her desire to keep their relationship private: “No phone, no pics, no postin us,” she sings at one point. “This love just ain’t disposable.” As one fan on Twitter noted, the song seems to be “literally about her and Dalton.”</p><p>“She’s talking about how he should say ‘I do’ and they are engaged, she’s saying to not post any photos and to keep their life personal life private,” the fan observed. And TBH, that’s not a far cry from how Ari and Dalton’s relationship started. The pair were first seen together in February 2020 when Ari was spotted <a href=#>kissing a mystery man</a> at a restaurant, with multiple sources claiming at the time that they were already seeing each other for “several months”—but their relationship remained unconfirmed until later that summer, when Ariana went IG official went her beau in June 2020.</p><p>But why all the secrecy?
