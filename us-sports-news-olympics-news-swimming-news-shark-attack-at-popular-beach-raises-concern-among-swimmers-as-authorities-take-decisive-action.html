The United States continues to remain a hot spot for shark attacks. There have already been a total of 46 shark bites globally this year, and out of these 46, the US leads the way with 25.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>2023 shark attacks in the US</h2><p>Out of the 25 shark attacks in the US, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Florida leads with 13</a>, while Hawaii has 3. The state of New York has reported 5 shark bites so far, while South Carolina had reported 1 as of 17 July. Beaches like Key West, Florida Keys, and New Smyrna Beach continue to record the highest number of shark attacks in the Sunshine State.
