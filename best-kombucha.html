We’re no scientists and can’t necessarily speak to gut health, but these kombucha flavors and kombucha brands are sure to make your mouth happy.</p><p>Our taste tests are typically guided by a pretty simple question: Does the thing we’re tasting, you know, taste good? Leave it to a gelatinous glob of bacteria to gum up the works.&nbsp;</p><p>Kombucha, a tea-based beverage that’s fermented with the help of SCOBY (aka Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast, aka the aforementioned glob), is purported to promote gut health, strengthen the immune system, and even lower cholesterol. There’s no hard and fast science on these benefits—according to The New York Times, there isn’t even scientific consensus that the bacteria in ‘booch are probiotic. What we do know is that during the kombucha fermentation process, bacteria and yeast turn sugar into organic acids and carbon dioxide, giving the beverage fizz and the signature vinegar-y funk that makes it feel like it’s good for you. If a kombucha brand is too sweet or too much like a fizzy fruit juice, it just feels less healthy. Basically, the best kombucha needs to be a little gross to be good.&nbsp;</p><p>We sipped a bunch of kombucha brands and kombucha flavors and came up with seven that struck the perfect balance of sweetness, funk, and fizz—and bonus points if it actually tasted like tea.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

This fizzy, sweet-but-not-too-sweet kombucha was the best kombucha we tasted in two separate taste tests, thanks to a tart, crisp quality that truly channels a Pink Lady apple. It has a sweet aroma that reminded us of Martinelli’s apple juice, but the pleasant surprise is that its apple-y notes don’t overpower the flavor of tea. As one taster noted, it has the best balance of “drinkability, taste, and actually feeling like it’s doing something good for my gut.” Big ups to the whistling anthropomorphic apple on the label—we love a gut health queen.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best gt's kombucha" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BEST-KOMBUCHA-RANKING_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Classic ‘Booch Flavor</strong></p><strong>GT’s Synergy Raw Kombucha Trilogy</strong><p>If the idea of nine billion living probiotics wriggling down your gullet doesn’t give you the willies, this might be the best kombucha for you. Of all the kombucha brands we tried, GT’s Living Foods claims to be the first company to put kombucha on store shelves, and the brand’s Trilogy flavor has a classic ‘booch taste you might expect from the beverage’s retail progenitor. In case you were wondering, the “trilogy” of flavors in question is raspberry, lemon, and ginger, although we were only really able to detect lemon and ginger, a mouth-puckering combo that’s a classic kombucha flavor. According to Jordan, this one feels healthy, which “feels fun.” They also liked the bits of pulp at the bottom of the bottle— “You get ‘em and you chew ‘em a little.” (Sorry about everything.)&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best tasting kombucha" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BEST-KOMBUCHA-RANKING_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Juice Flavor</strong></p><strong>GT’s Synergy Raw Kombucha Watermelon Wonder</strong><p>Okay, I don’t know if people sip kombucha by the pool (mostly because I don’t have a pool), but this refreshing, fizzy ‘booch is the best kombucha for a sunny summer day. Pressed watermelon juice makes it taste like a fresh, fruity paleta with a touch of sourness that channels a watermelon candy minus the phony, saccharine flavor (GT’s kombuchas don’t have added sugar like many others do). Pour this kombucha flavor into a glass, stick a little paper umbrella in it, and sip away. With two ‘booches in our top three, GT’s is definitely one of the best kombucha brands on the market.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best kombucha" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_KOMBUCHA-UPDATED_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Ginger Burn</p><strong>Health-Ade Ginger Lemon</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>If you like a good ginger burn, you’re going to love this Health-Ade. It’s so gingery and lemony that it kind of reminds me of one of those little immunity-boosting shots you grab at the local juice bar when you feel like you’re coming down with a cold (but not quite that intense, of course). It shouldn’t be reserved for impending illness, but I think this is the best kombucha if you’re sick or getting there.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best kombucha better booch" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BEST-KOMBUCHA-RANKING_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Herbaceous</strong></p><strong>Better Booch Citrus Sunrise</strong><p>Despite an aroma two tasters described as “foot,” this canned concoction got high marks for its sage-forward flavor. The combination of a citrusy zip, leafy herbs, and a distinct tea flavor make it taste like an expensive candle smells, if that’s your thing (it’s mine, apparently). Plus, its delicate fizz is highly refreshing. It’s brewed with pu’erh tea, a leaf with an earthy, almost mushroomy flavor. The can doesn’t scream complexity, but you’ll find it here all the same—maybe just hold your nose if you don’t want to experience eau de toes.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best kombucha better booch" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BEST-KOMBUCHA-RANKING_GWYNEDD-STUART_SPORKED_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Tea Flavor</strong></p><strong>Better Booch Morning Glory</strong><p>You’d be surprised how many kombuchas don’t taste all that much like tea given that kombucha is, you know, made with tea. This one was a standout for its tea flavor, even if its peachy notes brought to mind a certain popular Snapple flavor. This might not be the best kombucha for people who don’t want their ‘booch to taste good, but I’d take this pleasantly sour sip over an actual Snapple any day. Sorry, Wendy the Snapple Lady! (Remember the ‘90s?)</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best kombucha" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_KOMBUCHA-UPDATED_INSET_07.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Low Sugar</p><strong>Humm Blackberry</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Humm makes low-sugar kombucha, but it’s delicious even if you’re not watching your sugar intake. Blackberry Humm contains just 7 grams of sugar per can (none of it added sugar), compared to 12 to 17 grams in a bottle of Health-Ade. There’s a size discrepancy, but you get the point. And, personally, I like that this kombucha comes in a much smaller container than some competing brands—it’s less of a commitment! We tasted a few flavors of Humm—Blueberry Mint and Pomegranate Lemonade—but Blackberry was the best kombucha flavor of the bunch. It tastes like a delicious berry shrub (aka, a syrup made with vinegar, fruit, and aromatics). A highly pleasant sip!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best kombucha" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_KOMBUCHA-UPDATED_INSET_08.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Sugar Free</strong></p><strong><strong>Remedy Ginger Lemon</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>A lot of kombucha is absolutely jam-packed with sugar. And, frankly, it’s annoying to consume a bunch of something that’s bad for you when you’re drinking a beverage that’s supposed to be good for you. If you’re cutting down on sugar or you’re on a low-sugar diet, Remedy is the best kombucha brand for your needs. This Ginger Lemon variety can’t quite hang with Health-Ade Ginger Lemon (see number four on our list) when it comes to big, bold ginger flavor, but it’s gentle and refreshing and tart. It’s got a lot of what you love in the best kombucha with only ten calories a can. Some of the other flavors we tried (Peach, in particular) lacked that signature kombucha tang, but the lemon makes up for it here.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rhett-link-s-pick>Rhett & Link’s Pick</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gt-s-synergy-raw-kombucha-trilogy><strong>GT’s Synergy Raw Kombucha Trilogy</strong></h3><p>“This is nice ‘cause you get the bit of the ginger, but you get the berries to kind of make your mouth happy,” Link said during a kombucha taste test on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Mythical Morning</a>. And Rhett agreed with us about good kombucha tasting like kombucha: “I feel like you’re going to make the decision to drink kombucha, you should know you’re drinking kombucha. And I know I’m drinking kombucha when I’m drinking this kombucha.” That’s why it landed so high on our list, but we just couldn’t resist the crisp, appley flavor of the Health-Ade Pink Lady Apple.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Kombucha Taste Test" title='Play video "Kombucha Taste Test"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfAPuWq8P7w</a></figure><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Film your own taste test at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFut86mma6bmJZ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
