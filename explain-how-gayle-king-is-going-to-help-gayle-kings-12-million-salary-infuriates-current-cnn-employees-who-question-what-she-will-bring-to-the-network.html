While Barkley confirmed the report, he also said nothing was set in stone.</p><p>CNN’s viewership declined 35 percent during the year’s first quarter, with only 535,000 primetime viewers. The quarterly ratings are the network’s lowest since 2015. A source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> RadarOnline that employees were angry King may be paid so well while being told the network’s funds were low after 400 employees were laid off last December.</p><p>“Everyone has been told there’s no money, yet they’re managing to scrape up cash to pay Gayle King,” that person is quoted as saying. “It’s incredibly tone-deaf, as well as being rude to the hard-working people who’ve been toiling here for years!”</p><p>The source also claimed that King was offered a deal to stay at CBS that would allow her to do the CNN primetime show as well. The outlet also claimed that CNN producer <strong>Chris Licht</strong> would allow King to “write her own check” due to the low ratings on the network.</p><p>“Explain how Gayle King is going to help?
