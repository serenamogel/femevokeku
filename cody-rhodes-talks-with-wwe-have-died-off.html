Additionally, I was told that discussions had been ongoing between Cody and WWE, but I was told ‘those conversations have since fizzled out.’ Once source indicated that there is hope that Cody can be brought back into the AEW fold. The idea was floated to me that there might be a possibility again, with a new role involving the ROH acquisition.”</p><p>AEW President and CEO Tony Khan said Wednesday (March 2) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he tried his best to retain Rhodes</a> and thought at one point that he would succeed in keeping him with the company.</p><p>Khan said he tried to negotiate a longer agreement beyond the option years with Rhodes. Unfortunately, the two sides couldn’t agree to a new deal and it became apparent that Rhodes was leaving AEW.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
