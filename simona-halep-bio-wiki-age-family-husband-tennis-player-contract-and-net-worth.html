Her 22nd title followed in September when she beat an injured Karolina Pliskova in the Italian Open final.</p><p>At the 2020 French Open, Halep was the heavy favorite and won her first three matches in straight sets, until losing to eventual champion Iga Świątek in the fourth round whilst only winning three games. As a result, she missed out on regaining the No. 1 ranking. Halep started 2021 at Gippsland, where she was defeated in the quarterfinals by Ekaterina Alexandrova.

Halep returned to play at the 2021 National Bank Open. She received a bye into the second round where she was upset by Danielle Collins in three sets.</p><p>Halep won her first match back since her calf injury at the 2021 Western & Southern Open against Magda Linette in the first round.
